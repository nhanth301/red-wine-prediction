# red-wine-quality-prediction

## Introduction
This project focuses on predicting the quality of red wine based on its chemical attributes. In this project, we build a prediction model using machine learning techniques and an end-to-end workflow.

## Objectives
- Develop a reliable model for predicting red wine quality based on chemical characteristics.
- Execute an end-to-end workflow from data collection, preprocessing, model building, evaluation, to deployment.

## How to run?
### Run locally
#### STEPS:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nhanth301/wine-quality-prediction.git
```

```bash
cd wine-quality-prediction
```

```bash
conda create -n env python=3.8 -y
```

```bash
conda activate env
```

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```bash
python3 app.py
